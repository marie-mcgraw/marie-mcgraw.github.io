    <h4 align="left">Predicting Extreme Sea Ice Loss on Day-to-Day Timescales</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;" align="left">
	<li>Predictions of sea ice loss are often focused on longer timescales, but sea ice variability is also important on daily timescales.  When extreme sea ice loss occurs over timescales of a few days, this sea ice loss can have large impacts on Arctic weather, as well as local communities that use sea ice for hunting and travel.  Since there is some indication that these extreme sea ice loss events are driven by consistent atmospheric patterns, we are exploring whether or not weather forecasting models are able to skilfully predict these extreme events.  If you are excited about sea ice prediction, check out the <a href="https://atmos.uw.edu/sipn/">Sea Ice Prediction Network</a>. </li>

<h4 align="left">Applying Causal Discovery Methods to Atmospheric and Climate Science </h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;" align="left">
<li> As part of my Ph.D., I worked on making causality-based tools more accessible to atmospheric and climate scientists.  I worked closely with colleagues in electrical and computer engineering to refine and apply causality-based methods and algorithms to climate science problems, detailed in a co-written manuscript (<a href="papers/Samarasinghe_McGraw_Environ_2018.pdf">here</a>).  This collaboration also heavily influenced my work on two-way Arctic-midlatitude feedbacks (<a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_JClim_2020.pdf">here</a>).  I have continued my interest in methods based on statistics and data science by attending workshops such as the CMIP6 Hackathon. </br> </li>
    
<li>In addition to using causality tools to produce new scientific results, I have also emphasized clear and effective communication of these methods and approaches to make them more accessible to the atmospheric and climate science community.  This desire to improve accessibilty was the primary driver behind my statistical discussion of the advantages of Granger causality in climate science research (<a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_2018.pdf">here</a>).  I am currently working on making the analysis in this paper publicly available; in the meantime, I helped my colleague Savini Samarasinghe create an <a href="https://github.com/savinims/DATAS_Causal_Discovery">example</a> based on my Monte Carlo simulations.  We discuss this further over at the <a href="https://datasgateway.colostate.edu">DATAS gateway</a>. I further built upon my interests in communicating and teaching of analysis and data science ideas by working as a teaching assistant for a graduate-level Objective Analysis course.  </br> </li>

<h4 align="left">Understanding the Two-Way Nature of Arctic-Midlatitude Feedbacks</h4>
	Midlatitude weather and climate, including the jet streams, can be influenced by the weather and climate of the Arctic.  As the Arctic warms and sea ice melts, scientists project that this warming could have large impacts on lower latitudes.  However, the jet streams, storm tracks, and other features of midlatitude weather and climate can also influence the Arctic.  Much of my Ph.D. work was focused on understanding the relationships between Arctic and midlatitude weather and climate using this two-way perspective.  My colleague <a href="https://github.com/savinims">Savini Samarasinghe</a> and I worked together using multiple different casual discovery-based methods to highlight the two-way nature of these connections, and to show how changes in jet behavior can amplify or modulate Arctic temperatures on a day-to-day basis (<a href="papers/Samarasinghe_McGraw_Environ_2018.pdf">here</a>).  I expanded on some of this work by highlighting the role that the midlatitude circulation plays in influencing Arctic weather on these sub-monthly timescales (<a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_2020.pdf">here</a>).  Finally, I co-led a study with colleague Cory Baggett (link to Cory's website) that highlighted how sea ice loss could impact midlatitude moisture transport into the Arctic--moisture transport that can play a large role in Arctic weather and climate (<a>papers/McGraw_etal_ClimDyn_2020.pdf">here</a>).  

<h4 align="left">Jet Variability and Climate Change</h4>
	The jet streams play a substantial role in the storms, precipitation, weather, and climate of the midlatitudes.  Understanding how the strength, position, and variability of the jet streams might change in a warmer atmosphere is key to understanding the future weather and climate.  I have used a set of idealized atmospheric model simulations to suggest that the jet stream response to climate change can be quite different in different seasons (<a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_JClim_2016.pdf">here</a>).  I used the same idealized model to look at how the relationship between the speed and position of the jet streams in these simple models is different in different seasons (<a>href="papers/Woollings_etal_JClim_2017.pdf">here</a>).  Simple model experiments like these can help scientists develop a stronger understanding of the basic physics of the atmosphere, which we can then apply to studies of real-world observations or more complicated climate models. 
 
I have used this experience with simplified models and understanding of atmospheric dynamics concepts as a graduate teaching assistant for Atmospheric Dynamics I.

<h4 align="left">Volcanic Eruptions and the Large-Scale Circulation</h4>
	Large volcanic eruptions can have a large impact on global weather and climate for as many as 3 years following the eruption.  However, large eruptions are infrequent, and climate variability can be quite large, making a comprehensive understanding of these complicated interactions challenging if we limit ourselves to observations. I used over 200 climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Version 5 (CMIP5) and the NCAR Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble to study the variability of the large-scale atmospheric circulation response to large volcanic eruptions.  With hundreds of examples of post-eruption atmospheres, I was able to highlight the role of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation in modulating the response of the Southern Hemisphere, and to show how much variability there is in this response.  I was also able to suggest that the apparent difference between the observed post-volcanic atmospheric response and the most common atmospheric response in the climate models can be explained by the state of El Niño (<a href="papers/McGraw_etal_GRL_2016.pdf">here</a>).
