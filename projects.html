	<br>Currently, my research is focused on applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to weather and climate problems. Most of my current projects fit one of three themes centered around the intersection of AI and atmospheric science: <b>using AI to advance scientific discovery</b>; <b>AI and tropical cyclone forecasting</b>; and <b>adapting AI methods for earth science applications</b>. In the last couple of years, most of my research projects have been focused on tropical meteorology and AI, but I have worked on a variety of other topics in weather and climate in the past (see more here).

    <summary><b>Climate Variability and Change</b></summary>
    <ul> 
	I started my career studying climate variability and change. While my interests have grown and expanded since then, I still enjoy studying spatial and temporal patterns of climate variability and understanding climate model scenarios. A few topics that I've worked on include: 
        <li><b>Jet variability in a changing climate</b>: The jet stream plays a large role in weather and climate variability of North America, Europe, and eastern Asia. It often influences the strength and movement of large storms that regularly have wind damage, flooding, power outages, and other economic impacts. As the Earth warms, climate models predict that the jet stream will move towards the poles, which could change how these storms behave, and where they tend to have their largest impacts. We used idealized models (simple models that solve the equations of thermodynamics atmospheric motion on a rotating sphere) as well as climate models to try to better understand the physics of how and why the jet stream would respond to stimuli like volcanic eruptions or climate change. (<a href="papers/Woollings_etal_JClim_2017.pdf">Woollings et al. (2017)</a>, <a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_JClim_2016.pdf">McGraw and Barnes (2016)</a>; <a href="papers/McGraw_etal_GRL_2016.pdf">McGraw et al. (2016)</a>)
 </li>
        <li><b>Extratropical–Polar Climate Variability</b>: If you’ve ever watched a winter storm move from the Rocky Mountains towards the east, seen an atmospheric river travel across the Pacific to dump rain and snow on the West Coast, or experienced a Nor’easter, you know that the atmospheric patterns in one location can quickly impact those in another location. For some reason (a love of solitude? An Alaskan road trip the summer after college?), I’ve found myself drawn to extratropical-polar climate variability. I've studied these patterns of climate variability in climate model scenarios and reanalysis, and often used causal discovery modeling to identify feedback loops. (<a href="papers/McGraw_Barnes_JClim_2020.pdf">McGraw and Barnes (2020)</a>, <a href="papers/Samarasinghe_McGraw_Environ_2018.pdf">Samarasinghe et al. (2019)</a>, <a href="papers/McGraw_etal_ClimDyn_2020.pdf">McGraw et al. (2020)</a>)
</li>
        <li><b>Polar Climate Variability and Sea Ice</b>: My postdoc at the University of Washington was a great opportunity for me to try something new. I was lucky to get a position working with Prof. Cecilia Bitz, one of the foremost experts on sea ice and polar climate variability and change. I combined my weather and climate background with my love of statistics and data science to quantify weather models’ skill at predicting extreme sea ice loss events. While I’m not working on sea ice currently, I had a great time diving into a new-to-me aspect of our climate system with Prof. Bitz and her group, and I’m still hoping I can convince one of them to take me on a scientific expedition to Antarctica someday!

	<li><b>Tropical Climate Variability</b>: Tropical climate variability affects not just the climate of the tropics–it also affects the weather and climate patterns in the rest of the globe. I've worked on studies related to intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) formation events in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The ITCZ has large impacts on the global circulation, and on where rain falls in the tropics, so understanding what governs changes in the ITCZ is important for weather and climate forecasting. I've also developed a prototype model for a climate-invariant tropical cyclone intensity prediction model that was scaled by maximum potential intensity (that is, the theoretical maximum intensity a tropical cyclone can reach given the background shear, humidity, and sea surface temperature).  Incorporating physical knowledge can improve machine learning models of weather and climate phenomena, and make them more trustworthy. (<a href="papers/Gonzalez_etal_JClim_2022.pdf>Gonzalez et al. (2022)</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsSfi_84qyM">AI for Tropical Meteorology: Challenges and Opportunities</a>, AI for Good Seminar Series. 
</li>
	<li><b>Artificial Intelligence and Climate Variability</b>: The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in climate modeling has increased rapidly. My climate-invariant model of tropical cyclone intensity prediction uses physically-guided machine learning to try to develop a framework for tropical cyclone intensity prediction that will be robust in a changing, warming climate. I also participated in an exploratory work on using machine learning for bias correction of decadal climate predictions as part of the ClimateChangeAI 2022 Summer School. Neural network methods show promise for bias correction of climate model predictions due to their ability to learn both spatial and temporal information together--something that traditional methods can struggle to do.

    <summary><b>AI and Tropical Meteorology</b></summary>
    <ul> 
	Much of my work at CIRA has focused on developing machine learning models for various tropical cyclone forecasting tasks. Many of our models are developed with the end goal of producting operational forecast products for use at the National Hurricane Center or elsewhere at NOAA. 
        <li><b>United Nations AI for Good Seminar</b>: If you want an overview of my thoughts on AI and tropical meteorology, and many of the projects I’ve worked on, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsSfi_84qyM">United Nations AI for Good Seminar</a> that I gave with Professor Tom Beucler in 2023.
 </li>
        <li><b>Tropical Cyclone Artificial Neural-network Error Model</b>: We developed a neural network model that predicts tropical cyclone forecast errors for track and intensity. Our retrospective analyses have shown that our model has skill at track and intensity forecasting, and has the potential to reduce forecast uncertainty. This model is currently in the research to operations pipeline at the National Hurricane Center, and will hopefully be tested in real time in 2025. (<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/36Hurricanes/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/441911">Mark DeMaria's AMS Tropical Meteorology conference talk about machine learning estimates of TC track and intensity errors</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09840">Martin Fernandez's paper</a> that is in press at <i>Artificial Intelligence in the Earth Systems</i>, <a href="https://rammb-data.cira.colostate.edu/tc_realtime/">real-time website</a> with TCANE forecasts--should be live for the 2025 tropical cyclone season!)
</li>
        <li><b>TC Structure in Synthetic Microwave Imagery</b>: Kathy Haynes at CIRA led an effort to create synthetic passive microwave imagery from geostationary satellite imagery. Passive microwave imagers are on polar orbiting satellites, which only pass over a given location twice per day, at most; the synthetic passive microwave imagery provides synthetic microwave images at 10 minute intervals. We are now using this high time resolution synthetic passive microwave data to study tropical cyclone evolution and structure at high time resolutions that aren’t available with observed satellite imagery. 
(<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/105ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/454498">my recent talk at the AMS AI conference</a>)</li>
	<li><b>TCBench</b>: My collaborators at the Universite de Lausanne have led an effort to create a benchmarking dataset for tropical cyclone predictions in AI weather models. We are hoping to submit this benchmarking dataset to NeurIPS 2025. (<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/36Hurricanes/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/441809">Milton Gomez's poster </a> at the AMS Tropical Meteorology conference in 2024). </li>
	<li><b>Tropical Cyclone Formation Probability</b>: We are using machine learning models such as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees to create extended global tropical cyclogenesis forecasts (that is, we want to predict how likely a tropical cyclone is to form at a given location over the next 5-7 days). This project was started by Marshall Baldwin, a 2022 Hollings Scholar. (<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/103ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/413396">Marshall Baldwin's talk</a> about machine learning and tropical cyclogenesis). </li>
	<li><b>Causal discovery for hurricane forecasting:</b> Dr. Saranya Ganesh Sudheesh developed a causal discovery model that identified potential new predictors for statistical hurricane intensity forecasts. Her work identified 6 potential new predictors that are currently being tested in existing operational tropical cyclone intensity forecast models. (<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/436166">Tom Beucler's AMS Tropical talk</a> about causal feature selection for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting.)</li>

		<li>Much of my work in the last few years has focused on machine learning and tropical cyclone forecasting. Some of my projects include machine learning and tropical cyclone intensity forecasting; using AI-generated simulated passive microwave data to examine tropical cyclone structure; machine learning and tropical cyclogenesis; and using machine learning to estimate tropical cyclone track and intensity forecast uncertainty for realtime TC forecasting operations. <br>

    <h4 align="left">Uncertainty Quantification for AI Methods in Geosciences</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;" align="left">
		<li>Neural networks are becoming a popular analysis and prediction tool for many geoscience applications.  However, in addition to making a prediction of the mean state, many geoscientists also want to be able to estimate the uncertainty of their predictions, in order to estimate how confident we can be in our predictions, as well as to better understand the full range of possible outcomes. We compared several common uncertainty quantification methods and their performance in geoscience tasks, such as making predictions from satellite imagery, to try to understand the pros and cons of various uncertainty quantification methods in geoscience applications. I am also part of a team that is developing a neural network model that can forecast tropical cyclone track and intensity errors in real time. We are working on bringing this model to the National Hurricane Center; in the meantime, you can see example forecasts on the <a href="https://rammb-data.cira.colostate.edu/tc_realtime/storm_wind_speed_probabilities.asp?storm_identifier=al142024">TC Realtime website</a>.<br>

    <h4 align="left">AI and Ethics</h4>	
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;" align="left">
	<li>As AI explodes in popularity for geoscience prediction, it raises a host of questions about ethics, responsibility, and bias. We broke down different forms of bias for AI applications in earth sciences, including data biases, statistical and computational biases, human biases, and systemic and structural biases. I am especially interested in better understanding data biases and how they affect AI modeling results, particularly selection bias and processing bias, and the intersection of data biases and statistical/computational biases. <br>
